I have changed the implementation to be more efficient :) (Changed when the update function is called, and now should be optimal)
There may be errors but I cannot test for them yet (see line 1), but they should be trivial at worst.
Finished Testing files. Until the MovieDataReaderInterface implementation is complete, the tests will report NullPointerExceptions (caught and
print out a message that contains all needed info as well)

The private static final boolean USING_DUMMY variables have been set to false in order to allow testing for non dummy classes. To test
functionality of the backend exclusively, switch these variables to true and run the dummy tests. Note that both variables in the Backend.java 
and the TestBackend.java need to be set to the correct value for correct test results.
**THERE SHOULD NO LONGER BE ANY NEED TO MESS WITH THESE VARIABLES**

NOTE: The HashTableMap that I uploaded should be replaced by the Integration Manager's version for the final work. It should not matter
in terms of how the program works, but this was specified in the instructions.
**This has been successfully replaced and we should be good to go!**
