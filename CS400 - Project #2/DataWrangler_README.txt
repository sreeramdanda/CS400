Files Written by Me:
--------------------
Word.java
	Word object that stores definitions and origin for a word. Also implements the Comparable interface 
	for use in the RedBlackTree and has a custom overriden toString().

DictionaryDataReader.java
	Static Class that parses the Oxford dictionary text file for words and their associated data. Choose a 
	static class over a instanciable class since it seemed like an easier and less error prone approach.
	See .java file for details on implementation and rationale for particular object choice.

DataWranglerTests.java
	Junit testing class for methods used in DictionaryDataReader.java and Word.java.

Additional Contributions:
-------------------------
Assisting team members with fixing bugs
Creating an early Makefile so that we could test code as we wrote it
